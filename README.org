* Advent of Code 2019 Solutions
My solutions for [[https://adventofcode.com/2019][Advent of Code 2019]].

Currently using =JavaScript=.

** Getting Started
Get started by installing the packages:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  npm install
#+END_SRC

** Testing
Run the tests using =jest=.

A single run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  npm run test
#+END_SRC

Or with with =--watch=:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  npm run test-watch
#+END_SRC

** Linting
Using =eslint= with =airbnb= rules.

Run the linter:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  npm run lint
#+END_SRC

This will run =eslint --fix= which automatically fixes any issues it finds.

** Project Structure
